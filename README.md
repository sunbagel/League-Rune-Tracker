# League of Legends Rune Finder Discord Bot
A Discord bot that is able to search up runes for you on the go! The initial plan was to make this for a friend who had trouble running a browser and Discord at the same time while playing League of Legends, so I wanted to make a bot that could do the searching for him.

I made this bot using the Discord API, Javascript, and the Puppeteer Node.js package.

I still have a lot to work on in terms of the UI, adding in other rune options and potentially build paths, but the bot is nearly functional at this stage. 

In Season 13, it seems like LOL has added very similar functionality straight into the client, so I likely won't be continuing this project.
